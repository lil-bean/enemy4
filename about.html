    <p> is an interactive piece about wanting to talk to someone you're not supposed to talk to. it's about talking about talking about talking about someone to cope with not talking to them. it's about talking to them in your head, talking to your version of them, talking to yourself. it's about what counts as talking and not-talking.</p>
    <br>
    <p> the interactive elements of this piece are intended to play with what it means to be poetic. is this a poem? maybe just a really bad one? if it's not a poem, what is it? what happens when you introduce interactive elements? what happens when you present this digitally? what happens when elements of social media platforms are used this way? </p>
    <br>
    <p> who are you talking to? </p>
